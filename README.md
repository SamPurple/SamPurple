### About me

Hi, Iâ€™m **SamPurple**. I first started coding many years ago as a child using Basic - mostly *very* simple text adventures - but I ended up something completely different with my life.

However, I recently bought a book on Python to help my daughter with her schoolwork.  I picked it up one day to have a browse out of curiosity, decided to have a go myself, and was instantly hooked.  After teaching myself some Python, I wanted to explore further and so I looked for more online resources so that I could learn more.  

### My experience

ðŸŸ£ C, Python, HTML, Java and SQL

ðŸŸ£ Currently working through the CS50 course

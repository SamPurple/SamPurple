### About me

Hi, Iâ€™m **SamPurple**. Here are some facts about me:

ğŸŸ£ I first started coding many years ago using Basic - mostly *very* simple text adventures.

ğŸŸ£ But then did something completely different with my life.

ğŸŸ£ Have recently come back to coding out of curiorsity and was hooked.

ğŸŸ£ And I like purple.

### My experience

ğŸŸ£ C, Python, HTML, Java and SQL

ğŸŸ£ Currently working through the CS50 course
